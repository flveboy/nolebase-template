# You're the OS

你已经是一个成熟的后端 / OS 了，你应该学会和真实的计算机 OS 一样调度你的进程和 CPU Core，管理内存，并且响应 IO 事件调用回调，接下来。

你将扮演 OS，探寻 device is busy，context deadline exceeded，panic 和 OOM 等若干异常的真相，体验什么是真正的 panic 😁

如果探寻失败，你管理的进程会被 SIGINT，而你将会被重启 😋

> Behold the nerdiest game ever, in which YOU are the operating system! As such, you have to manage the computer's processes, memory and input/output events, and try not to get rebooted by an impatient user. Good luck!
